# sphinx-examples: Code examples simplified

In this example project, we have enabled the extension `sphinx-examples` in `_config.yml` to be able to display source code alongside its rendered result.

You can use it this way:

```{example} Use examples to show source code and rendered result
```{example} Example title
Here's my **example**!
```
