# Abstract

Entity Resolution constitutes a core data integration task that has attracted a bulk of works on improving its effectiveness and time efficiency. This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the
field, distinguishing relevant methods into five main generations. The
first one targets Veracity in the context of structured data with a clean
schema. The second generation extends its focus to cover Volume, as
well, leveraging multi-core or massive parallelization to process large-
scale datasets. The third generation addresses the additional challenge of
Variety, targeting voluminous, noisy, semi-structured, and highly hetero-
geneous data from the Semantic Web. The fourth generation also tackles
Velocity so as to process data collections of a continuously increasing
volume. The latest works, though, belong to the fifth generation, involv-
ing pre-trained (large) language models which heavily rely on external
knowledge to address all four Vs with high effectiveness.
